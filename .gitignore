# ============================================
# Firebase Configuration Files (SENSITIVE)
# ============================================
# These files contain sensitive Firebase project credentials and should NOT be
# committed to version control. Each developer must download their own copies
# from the Firebase Console after setting up their local Firebase project.

# Android Firebase config
/android/app/google-services.json

# iOS Firebase config
/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

# macOS Firebase config
/macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

# Firebase CLI configuration (may contain project-specific settings)
# Note: firebase.json and .firebaserc are project-level configs.
# Uncomment if you want to ignore them (typically safe for portfolio projects):
# /firebase.json
# /.firebaserc

# ============================================
# Firebase Options (Optional)
# ============================================
# lib/firebase_options.dart is generated by FlutterFire CLI and contains
# platform-specific Firebase configuration. For personal/portfolio projects,
# it's typically committed. For team projects, teams may choose to ignore it
# and regenerate it per developer. Currently NOT ignored.
# /lib/firebase_options.dart

# Environment variables
